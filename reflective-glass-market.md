<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Reflective Glass Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Traditional Reflective Glass</li><li>Subtly Reflective Glass</li><li>Spectrally Selective Glass</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The reflective glass market can be classified into three types based on their characteristics and functionality. Traditional reflective glass, as the name suggests, offers a high level of reflectance, providing privacy and reducing solar heat gain. Subtly reflective glass has a lower level of reflectance, offering a subtle reflection while allowing natural light to flow into buildings. On the other hand, spectrally selective glass is designed to selectively filter and control solar radiation, reducing both heat gain and glare while still allowing a high amount of visible light transmission.</p></p>
