<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Impedance Muffler Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Expansion</li><li>Resonance Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The impedance muffler market consists of two main types: expansion and resonance. In expansion type mufflers, the exhaust gases are directed through a series of cones or diffusers to create expansion chambers. These chambers increase the muffler's volume, which helps reduce noise levels. Resonance type mufflers, on the other hand, use a chamber with specific dimensions to create sound waves that cancel out the noise produced by the engine. By utilizing these different techniques, both expansion and resonance mufflers effectively minimize noise pollution in various automotive applications.</p></p>
