<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Antirust Paint Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Physical Antirust Paint</li><li>Chemical Antirust Paint</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The antirust paint market is divided into two types: physical antirust paint and chemical antirust paint. Physical antirust paint provides a protective coating that acts as a physical barrier against moisture and air, preventing rust formation. It is typically applied as a thick layer and offers long-lasting protection. On the other hand, chemical antirust paint contains specific chemicals that inhibit the rusting process by reacting with the metal surface, forming a protective layer. It is commonly used in industrial applications where high corrosion resistance is required.</p></p>
