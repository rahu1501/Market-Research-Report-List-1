<p><strong>The Car Active Head Restraints Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Headrest Activation</li><li>Seat Back Activation</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Car active head restraints are safety features designed to protect passengers in case of a rear-end collision. There are two types of car active head restraints: headrest activation and seat back activation. In headrest activation, the headrest is automatically pushed forward in a rear-end impact to support the occupant's head and neck, reducing the risk of whiplash injuries. On the other hand, seat back activation involves the entire seat back moving forward to support the occupant. Both types provide added protection and improve passenger safety during rear-end collisions.</p></p>
