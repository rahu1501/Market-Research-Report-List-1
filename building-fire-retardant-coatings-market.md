<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Building Fire Retardant Coatings Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Water-based</li><li>Solvent-based</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Building fire retardant coatings are specialized coatings that are applied to surfaces in order to prevent the spread of fire. There are two main types of fire retardant coatings: water-based and solvent-based. Water-based coatings are made from materials that are dissolved in water and provide a protective layer when applied to surfaces. On the other hand, solvent-based coatings are made from materials that are dissolved in a solvent, such as alcohol or petroleum, and form a protective barrier when applied. Both types of coatings are effective in reducing the flammability of surfaces and preventing the spread of fire.</p></p>
