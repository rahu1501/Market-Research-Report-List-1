<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Metal Plating Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Electroplating</li><li>Electroless Plating</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Metal plating is a process used to coat metal objects with another metal layer to enhance their appearance, durability, and corrosion resistance. Electroplating involves passing an electric current through a solution containing metal ions, which attracts the ions to the metal object's surface. Electroless plating, on the other hand, does not require electricity as it utilizes a chemical reaction to deposit a metal layer onto the object. Both techniques are widely used in various industries, including automotive, electronics, and aerospace, to improve the quality and performance of metal components.</p></p>
