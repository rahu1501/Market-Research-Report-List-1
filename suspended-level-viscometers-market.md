<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Suspended-Level Viscometers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Type I</li><li>Type II</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Suspended-level viscometers are divided into two main types: Type I and Type II. Type I viscometers are designed for measuring the viscosity of Newtonian fluids, which have a constant viscosity at different shear rates. These viscometers primarily use a fixed volume of fluid and measure the time it takes for the fluid to flow through a capillary. On the other hand, Type II viscometers are suitable for measuring non-Newtonian fluids, which exhibit varying viscosity under different shear rates. These viscometers typically allow for the adjustment of shear rates to accurately measure the viscosity of complex fluids.</p></p>
