<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automatic Fire Sprinklers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wet Fire Sprinklers</li><li>Dry Fire Sprinklers</li><li>Deluge Fire Sprinklers</li><li>Preaction Fire Sprinklers</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Automatic Fire Sprinklers Market consists of several types, each serving a specific purpose. Wet fire sprinklers are the most common and utilize water as a suppressant, ready to immediately extinguish a fire upon activation. Dry fire sprinklers are suitable for environments that may freeze, using pressurized air or nitrogen to prevent water from freezing in the pipes. Deluge fire sprinklers are designed for high-risk areas where rapid fire spread is possible, as they release a large amount of water simultaneously. Preaction fire sprinklers combine elements of both wet and dry systems, requiring two triggers to activate water flow.</p></p>
