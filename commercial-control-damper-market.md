<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Commercial Control Damper Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Light Duty</li><li>Heavy Duty</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Commercial Control Damper market is divided into two types: Light Duty and Heavy Duty. Light Duty dampers are designed for smaller commercial applications where airflow control is required, such as in retail stores or small office buildings. These dampers are usually smaller in size and have lower pressure ratings. On the other hand, Heavy Duty dampers are suitable for larger commercial settings with higher airflows, such as hospitals or industrial facilities. They are built to withstand higher pressures and offer more durable construction.</p></p>

<p><strong>The Commercial Control Damper Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Smoke Damper</li><li>Fire Damper</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The commercial control damper market mainly includes three applications: smoke dampers, fire dampers, and others. Smoke dampers are installed in ventilation systems to prevent the spread of smoke in case of a fire, ensuring a safe evacuation. Fire dampers, on the other hand, are designed to close automatically during a fire, preventing the fire and smoke from spreading through ductwork. Lastly, the "others" category encompasses dampers used in various commercial HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) systems to regulate airflow, temperature, and pressure.</p></p>
