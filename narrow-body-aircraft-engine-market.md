<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Narrow-body Aircraft Engine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Turbo fan engine</li><li>Turboprop engine</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The narrow-body aircraft engine market comprises two major types: turbofan engines and turboprop engines. Turbofan engines are commonly used on commercial airliners, providing efficient thrust for long-distance travel. These engines are popular due to their high bypass ratio, which enables better fuel efficiency and reduced noise. On the other hand, turboprop engines are generally used on regional aircraft. They harness the power of a gas turbine engine to drive a propeller, making them ideal for shorter distances and slower speeds. Both engine types cater to different aviation needs and have their distinct advantages.</p></p>
