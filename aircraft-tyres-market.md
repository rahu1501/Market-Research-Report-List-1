<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aircraft Tyres Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radial</li><li>Bias</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The aircraft tires market consists of two main types: radial tires and bias tires. Radial tires are designed with cords that run radially from the bead of the tire to the tread, providing greater flexibility and stability. These tires offer improved fuel efficiency, higher load-carrying capability, and better resistance to heat build-up. Conversely, bias tires have cords that crisscross diagonally, resulting in a stiffer tire structure. They are more affordable, have better resistance to damage, and are suitable for rough terrains. The choice between radial and bias tires depends on specific aircraft requirements and operating conditions.</p></p>
