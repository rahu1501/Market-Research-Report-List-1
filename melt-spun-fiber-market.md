<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Melt-spun Fiber Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Filament Melt-spun Fiber</li><li>Staple Melt-spun Fiber</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The melt-spun fiber market can be categorized into two main types: filament melt-spun fiber and staple melt-spun fiber. Filament melt-spun fiber refers to continuous, long fibers that are spun from a molten polymer and then cooled to solidify them. These fibers are commonly used in applications such as textiles, industrial fabrics, and geotextiles. On the other hand, staple melt-spun fiber consists of short fibers that are cut to a specific length after being formed. These fibers are often used in nonwoven fabrics, filtration media, and automotive textiles.</p></p>
