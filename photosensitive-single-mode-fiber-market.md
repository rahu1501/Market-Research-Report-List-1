<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Photosensitive Single Mode Fiber Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cladding Photosensitive Single Mode Fiber</li><li>Unclad Photosensitive Single Mode Fiber</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Photosensitive Single Mode Fiber refers to a type of fiber optic cable that is designed to exhibit photosensitivity, allowing for precise and controlled modifications to its refractive index. There are two main market types within this category: Cladding Photosensitive Single Mode Fiber and Unclad Photosensitive Single Mode Fiber. Cladding Photosensitive Single Mode Fiber is coated with a layer of low-index material, known as cladding, to confine light within the fiber core. On the other hand, Unclad Photosensitive Single Mode Fiber lacks this additional cladding layer, resulting in a simpler and more cost-effective design.</p></p>
