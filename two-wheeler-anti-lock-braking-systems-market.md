<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Two Wheeler Anti-lock Braking Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-channel ABS</li><li>Multi-channel ABS</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Two Wheeler Anti-lock Braking Systems (ABS) market consists of two types: Single-channel ABS and Multi-channel ABS. Single-channel ABS is a cost-effective system that controls the braking of only one wheel at a time, usually the front wheel. This system prevents wheel lock-up and skidding during sudden braking, enhancing the overall stability and control of the vehicle. On the other hand, Multi-channel ABS controls the braking of both wheels independently, improving the effectiveness of braking and providing enhanced stability and control during emergency braking situations.</p></p>
