<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Overfill Prevention System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Automatic</li><li>Manual</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Overfill Prevention System (OPS) market can be categorized into two types: Automatic and Manual. </p><p>Automatic OPSs are designed to act autonomously without human intervention, utilizing various technological components such as sensors, alarms, and shut-off valves to prevent overfilling in tanks or containers. This ensures a higher level of accuracy and reliability in detecting and preventing overfill incidents. </p><p>On the other hand, Manual OPSs require human intervention and operation. They involve a more hands-on approach, where individuals manually monitor fill levels and determine when to stop or transfer fluids. This type of system relies on human judgment and can be more prone to errors or delays if not managed properly.</p></p>
