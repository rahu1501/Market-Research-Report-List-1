<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Urban Rail Signalling Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Semi-automatic Train Operation</li><li>Driverless Train Operation</li><li>Unattended Train Operation</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Urban Rail Signalling Systems market is divided into three types: Semi-automatic Train Operation (STO), Driverless Train Operation (DTO), and Unattended Train Operation (UTO). STO refers to a system where a train operator controls the train's speed and monitors the tracks, while automatic controls handle braking and acceleration. DTO eliminates the need for a human driver and relies on advanced sensors and technology to operate the train. UTO takes automation a step further by completely removing onboard staff, allowing the train to run independently without human intervention.</p></p>
