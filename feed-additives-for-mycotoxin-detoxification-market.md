<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Feed Additives for Mycotoxin Detoxification Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Adsorbing Agent</li><li>Bio-Transforming Agent</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Feed Additives for Mycotoxin Detoxification market includes two main types: Adsorbing Agents and Bio-Transforming Agents. Adsorbing Agents are substances added to animal feed to bind with mycotoxins and prevent their absorption into the animal's body. They work by physically trapping mycotoxins in the digestive tract. On the other hand, Bio-Transforming Agents are additives that facilitate the biotransformation of mycotoxins into less harmful or non-toxic metabolites. They use enzymatic reactions to modify the chemical structures of mycotoxins, reducing their harmful effects on animals.</p></p>
