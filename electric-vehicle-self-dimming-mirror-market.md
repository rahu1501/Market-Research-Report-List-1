<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electric Vehicle Self-dimming Mirror Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Outer Self-dimming Mirror</li><li>Inside Self-dimming Mirror</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The electric vehicle self-dimming mirror market consists of two main types: outer self-dimming mirrors and inside self-dimming mirrors. Outer self-dimming mirrors are installed on the external sides of the vehicle, helping to reduce glare from headlights of the vehicles behind. They enhance the driver's visibility during nighttime driving, ensuring safer and more comfortable travel. On the other hand, inside self-dimming mirrors are positioned inside the vehicle, typically on the rear-view mirror. These mirrors automatically dim in response to the brightness of the headlights behind the vehicle, preventing glare and maintaining clear visibility for the driver. Both types contribute to improving driver safety and overall driving experience in electric vehicles.</p></p>
