<p><strong>The Cold Caps and Scalp Cooling Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Scalp Cool Caps</li><li>Scalp Cool Systems</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The cold caps and scalp cooling systems market consists of two types: scalp cool caps and scalp cool systems. Scalp cool caps are designed to fit snugly on a patient's head, reducing the temperature of the scalp and minimizing hair loss during chemotherapy treatments. On the other hand, scalp cool systems work by circulating a cooled liquid through a cap worn by the patient, achieving the same effect. Both options aim to provide relief to cancer patients by preserving their hair during treatment.</p></p>
